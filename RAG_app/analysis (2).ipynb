              "\"Relevant Content:\\nincreasing capabilities and token storage of LLMs in 2024 such as Google’s Med-Gemini, Meta’s Llama 3, OpenAI’s ChatGPT4, or Anthropic’s Claude 3.5, has allowed for these models to process the enormous portions of information for summarization and analysis. In recognition of the stringent accuracy, the need for personalization, privacy regulations, and the high knowledge floor needed for AI in clinical workflow, the innovation space gave birth to companies like Sporo Health to combat the aforementioned issues in clinical summarization using AI agents. Several case studies verify AI usage in various clinical settings to aid in chart review and summarization of clinical information. 3\\n\\nASSESSING THE ROLE OF CLINICAL SUMMARIZATION AND PATIENT CHART REVIEW WITHIN COMMUNICATIONS , MEDICAL MANAGEMENT ,AND DIAGNOSTICS Chanseo Lee Yale School of Medicine and Sporo Health New Haven, CT 06510 chanseo.lee@yale.eduKimon-Aristotelis Vogt Sporo Health Boston, MA 02134 kvogt@sporohealth.comSonu Kumar Sporo Health Boston, MA 02134 sonu@sporohealth.com July 25, 2024 ABSTRACT Effective summarization of unstructured patient data in electronic health records (EHRs) is crucial for accurate diagnosis and efficient patient care, yet clinicians often struggle with information overload and time constraints. This review dives into recent literature and case studies on both the significant impacts and outstanding issues of patient chart review on communications, diagnostics, and management. It also discusses recent efforts to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical summarization tasks, and its transformative impact on the clinician’s potential, including but not limited to\\n\\nM e t h o d s Wecollectedadatasetofde-identifiedpatientconversationtranscriptsfromoneofourpartnerclinics,generatedusingSporoHealth'sproprietaryspeakerlabelingandtranscriptionAI.Foreachpatientencounter,thepilotingclinicianprovidedSubjective,Objective,Assessment,andPlan(SOAP)notesthroughthescribeplatform,whichwedesignatedasthegroundtruth.SporoHealth’sAIagenticworkflow,alongwithGPT-4ominihostedwithinAzurePlayground,werethentaskedusingzero-shotpromptingwithgeneratingSOAP-formattedsummariesfromthesametranscripts.TheseAI-generatedsummariesweresubsequentlycomparedtotheclinician’sgroundtruthnotesusingvariousquantitativeevaluationmetrics.
